# TA_Gran
Calculate **total alkalinity (TA)** based on the Gran approximation using the outputs of **TitroLine7000** (automatic titrator).

This script was created in December 2019 by me (Giulia Puntin) and used in multiple occasions by my colleagues in our working group. However, the code can be improved. I started this repository as in incentive (to myself and friends) and opportunity to familiarize with version control. Therefore consider this, for now, as a **work in progress**!

## Future directions
TA is a very useful parameter to understand and study reef-building coral physiology. Specifically it is used to 1) characterize the seawater chemistry and 2) to estimate rates of calcification based on alkalinity anomaly (AA - as the difference in TA before and after an incubation). 
For these reasons, I believe (and hope) that this script can be useful to other people in the field. 
I will also (try my best to) provide further documentation and references necessary to better understand the chemical and mathematical underlyings of the calculations. 

Apologies in advance for the messy code, it will get better soon!
